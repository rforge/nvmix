### For first release ##########################################################

## Comments after fine-tuning for first release
- give more meaningful names than 'const' ("don't call a dog 'dog', give him
  a meaningful name"); I renamed it to 'is.const.mix' and put it next to 'qmix'
  where it (logically) belongs
- document arguments (pnvmix1()) that are already documented in another function
  (pnvmix()) via 'see ?pnvmix()'
- re-indented files: someone needs to learn Emacs :-) (or use right settings in
  R Studio to obtain 4 blanks indent per level). A good editor also gives you
  'parentheses matching', so no need to do ( ( ( (a + b) / 2 )))
- use 'if' as a function, so
  if() a <- b else a <- c should be a <- if() b else c
  (see 'next.estimate', for example)
- keep order in Roxygen heads (@note should come last)
- *within* functions, separate larger pieces of code by '## <title ####... ###'
  rather than empty lines (also good reminder of adhering to the 80-column rule)
- avoid ':' in leading comments (clear that they refer to the code thereafter)
- avoid comments 'EH' in code
- make comments shorter so that ideally can be done 'inline' next to the
  corresponding statement (avoid searching for corresponding comment)
- make inline comments shorter to ideally fit in the 80-column rule. Example:
  "initialize error to something bigger than abstol so that we can enter the while loop"
  => "initialize error to > abstol to enter while loop"
- thanks for looking into the mahalanobis() problem
- removed tryCatch() from 'factorize()': I think this was 'legacy code', it would
  be bad to just do the around chol() (as it was) as then not always the same
  object type is returned.
- 'archived' factorize() as not needed at the moment
- I omitted all tryCatch() for the following reason:
  We mostly used it as tryCatch(t(chol(...))). There is no point in doing that
  as t() will fail if chol(...) fails and the error message is semi-cryptic
  then. We would need to do tryCatch(chol(...)), then, in case of *no* error,
  pick out the resulting matrix and transpose it. Too complicated given that chol()
  already provides an informative error message ("... is not positive definite").
  Could still change that for next release but too much overhead/code for my taste.
- renamed all 'cholScale' to 'factor' (as we used that notion in dnvmix(), rnvmix().
- ?dnvmix, ?pnvmix and ?dnvmix could have a bit more documentation on the argument 'method'
  (there was none, I added a bit more). Are the 'sobol' and 'ghalton' methods *randomized*?
  This was given for some but not all methods. I went with the "least common multiple".
- Also use spaces in the .Rd, so \code{abstol = 0.00...} instead of \code{abstol=0.00...}
- Avoid abbreviations like 'e.g.' on the help files.
- Use proper quotation marks on the .Rd files (as in code): method = "sobol", not
  method = 'sobol', but okay to speak of the argument 'method' just its *value*
  is a (double-quoted) character string

## Questions
- why do we need 'const' (now: is.const.mix) and can't handle that with a corresponding
  quantile function?
- does the code correctly pick up the case where W is constant but not 1?
  (this theoretically changes the distribution)
- After dnvmix(), pnvmix() and the literature, it seems to make all the sense
  in the world to also make rnvmix()'s factor a *lower* triangular matrix
  (even if it uses another t() -- this would be much less confusing, we
  even use t(chol()) already in some case inside rnvmix() and
  two arguments with the same name but different meaning is
  extremely prone to errors).


### For the next release #######################################################

0) Please document in the .Rd via '% see ?pnvmix' all arguments on ?rnvmix and ?dnvmix
   which are actually the same as on ?pnvmix (several reasons for that).
1) Estimation
2) Singular matrices

- TODO Allow rmix() to be specified in pnvmix() for method = 'PRNG'. This can be a first
       Step towards evaluation GIG mixtures, where qmix() is not available but one can
       sample from the mixing distribution.
- TODO look into quantile functions of univariate (marginal) normal variance mixtures.
       If we have a function, say, qnvmix1 (for 1 dimensional normal variance mixtures),
       we have a way to sample from univariate normal variance mixtures using inversion,
       which can then be used for quasi-Monte Carlo sampling
- TODO Need fitnvmix(): check what other packages do

- DONE Does it make sense to choose the default of fun.eval[2] differently?
       MH: I feel it should be something like 1/abstol, so that if one plays
           with abstol, one has a reasonable chance not having to modify
           fun.eval[2]. I realized this when choosing abstol = 1e-8 (then
           with fun.eval[2] = 1e8, the computations took forever.
       EH: the default is set such that the algorithm terminates with reasonable
           tolerances (0.001, 0.0005, maybe 0.0001). Tolerances beyond that will take
           forever one way or another. My suggestion: Leave it for now.
       MH: ... until we see a 'law'


### Some former DONE ###########################################################

-DONE   Write vignette nvmix_functionality.Rmd
-DONE  'factor' in rnvmix/dnvmix changed to be consistent with paper
-DONE   There was a bug in rnvmix; it couldn't handle non-square 'factor' properly.
        [MH: Correct, never tested that.]
        Problem was that a *d* dimensional normal was simulated, should be *k* dimensional.
        [MH: Correct]
        Also, 'loc' needs to be *k* (not d) dimensional in this case.
        [MH: A should be (d,k), so the outcome must be d-dimensional and thus also
        loc must be d-dimensional]

        Note:
        *in the paper: A (which somewhat corresponds to our'factor') is a (d,k) matrix such that A A^T = scale.
        This is the definition in the QRM book.
        [MH: ... and the one we should follow (anything else is confusing)]
        The resulting nvmix dist'n has thus dimension *d*.
        [MH: correct]
        *in rnvmix: 'factor' is a (d,k) matrix such that A^T A = scale.
        The resulting nvmix dist'n has thus dimension *k*
        [MH: ... this is because chol() by default gives you an upper triangular Cholesky factor.
          For performance reasons, I wanted to avoid doing t(A) in the original code.
	  Maybe we can still avoid it? If not, do the t(), this is still better than loc being k-dimensional]

        I have left it the way it was (i.e. A^T A = scale) and fixed the bug.
        I originally wanted to change it to make it consistent with the paper,
        but it seems to be accepted that a factor is a matrix such that A^T A = scale.
        [MH: still, it's too confusing to be different from the literature]
        If you'd like it to be changed, that'd be fine for me, too, though. In this case, factorize() needs
        to be changed as well.
        [MH: yeah, should be changed (not sure whether also already in factorize [stay closer to R behavior?]).]

        Another remark:
        If rnvmix() is called with a *singular* scale, an error is thrown.
        [MH: How is that tested? couldn't immediately find. rnvmix() should be fast, no (too) long testing...]
        If the user wishes to sample from that singular distribution, they *have to* provide 'factor'.
        [MH: sounds ok]

        EH: Please see 'Major Changes'
- DONE	EH: 'rnvmix()' needs a 'method' argument (see 'pnvmix') + new argument 	'mix' ('rmix'?)
         for passing a RNG
         => call other arguments 'mix' 'qmix' instead (check carefully).
	dnvmix() and pnvmix() have 'qmix' (rather than 'mix') now; rnvmix() has both, 	'qmix' and 'rmix'
- DONE  EH: rnvmix() should have 'skip' if method = 'sobol'
- DONE  EH: renaming etc in dnvmix() similar to pnvmix()
- DONE	EH: TODOs inside pnvmix()
- DONE 	EH: pnvmix() has multiple lower/upper as input, but only one scale. pnvmix1()
        then calculates t(chol(scale)) for each input => maybe do that in pnvmix once and
        pass it as argument to pnvmix1()
- DONE ?pnvmix and ?dnvmix describe the output value 'numiter'. Can you had
      	(on each help pages) half a sentence what these iterations are exactly?
      	=> alternatively, shouldn't we rather return the variance? (one of the
         five components you previously returned) Seems more intuitive, no?
	EH: Will do. variance can be computed from error; numiter (or equivalently, total
        function evaluations) should just give an idea of how long it took to converge
- DONE	EH: ?pnvmix describes 'precond'; can you add half a sentence
  	describing the idea behind the preconditioning, please?
- DONE  implement dnvmix() as well as wrappers for normal/t case.
- DONE  (d=1): pnvmix() should work with d = 1 and with missing data
- DONE  pStudent should work with df = Inf
- DONE  implement multivariate normal distribution
- DONE  rename 'a' and 'b' to 'lower' and 'upper'; 'nu' to 'df'
        (first arg should be 'upper' with default lower being '-Inf,...')
- DONE  'R' should be 'scale' and we need a 'standardized = FALSE' argument;
        if standardized = TRUE, loc = 0 and sigma = correlation matrix is assumed
        ... or so)
- DONE  'swap' needs to be improved
- DONE  'func' not needed if 'base case' in pnvmix() is part of the loop
        (only one call necessary then, so can be omitted)
- DONE  more intuitive names for arguments concerning tolerance(s)
- DONE  polish ./src
