### For next release ###########################################################

## Important

- EH/MH: 'rnvmix()' needs a 'method' argument (see 'pnvmix') + new argument 'mix' ('rmix'?)
         for passing a RNG
         => call other arguments 'mix' 'qmix' instead (check carefully)
- EH: Does it make sense to choose the default of fun.eval[2] differently?
      I feel it should be something like 1/abstol, so that if one plays
      with abstol, one has a reasonable chance not having to modify
      fun.eval[2]. I realized this when choosing abstol = 1e-8 (then
      with fun.eval[2] = 1e8, the computations took forever.
- EH: ?pnvmix and ?dnvmix describe the output value 'numiter'. Can you had
      (on each help pages) half a sentence what these iterations are exactly?
      => alternatively, shouldn't we rather return the variance? (one of the
         five components you previously returned) Seems more intuitive, no?
	EH: variance can be computed from error; numiter (or equivalently, total function 	evaluations) should just give an idea of how long it took to converge

- EH: ?pnvmix describes 'precond'; can you add half a sentence
  describing the idea behind the preconditioning, please?

- EH: incorporate the case of a singular scale matrix
      (or at least give better error message)

- EH: TODOs inside pnvmix()
	EH: mostly done.

- Write vignette nvmix_functionality.Rmd

- TODO (maybe): pnvmix() has multiple lower/upper as input, but only one scale. pnvmix1() 	then calculates t(chol(scale)) for each input => maybe do that in pnvmix once and 	pass it as argument to pnvmix1()


- TODO Need fitnvmix(): check what other packages do


### TODO #######################################################################


- TODO look into quantile functions of univariate (marginal) normal variance mixtures.
       If we have a function, say, qnvmix1 (for 1 dimensional normal variance mixtures),
       we have a way to sample from univariate normal variance mixtures using inversion,
       which can then be used for quasi-Monte Carlo sampling
- DONE implement dnvmix() as well as wrappers for normal/t case.
- DONE (d=1): pnvmix() should work with d = 1 and with missing data
- DONE pStudent should work with df = Inf
- DONE implement multivariate normal distribution
- DONE rename 'a' and 'b' to 'lower' and 'upper'; 'nu' to 'df'
       (first arg should be 'upper' with default lower being '-Inf,...')
- DONE 'R' should be 'scale' and we need a 'standardized = FALSE' argument;
       if standardized = TRUE, loc = 0 and sigma = correlation matrix is assumed
       ... or so)
- DONE 'swap' needs to be improved
- DONE 'func' not needed if 'base case' in pnvmix() is part of the loop
       (only one call necessary then, so can be omitted)
- DONE more intuitive names for arguments concerning tolerance(s)
- DONE polish ./src


### More thoughts ##############################################################

pnvmix() does not work for multiple upper/lower input vectors, since the
preconditioning heavily depends on the input parameters. However, in d = 1,
since we have the function pnorm(), the integration problem is actually
one-dimensional. In this case, no reordering needs to be done and we can implement
a "vectorized" pnvmix1() (I use 1 to highlight that it works only for d = 1).
Indeed, we only need to sample from the mixture distribution and then evaluate
pnorm() with different upper/lower bounds. We can use common random numbers
(i.e. simulate from R, use these simulations for all upper/lower) and evaluate
the df efficiently at many points. This is particularly useful for
implementing qnvmix1(), since pnvmix1() can evaluate at multiple "upper" at once.
Still, pnvmix1() will only approximate the true df, numerically inverting that
approximated df will inevitably lead to numerical inaccuracies.
