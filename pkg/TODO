### TODO #######################################################################

- Need fitnvmix(): check what other packages do:
- pnvmix(): should work with d = 1 and with missing data
	d = 1 is DONE, what to do with missing data? Error?
- Do we want a function that has multiple lower and upper as input?
- pStudent should work with df = Inf
	DONE
- implement multivariate normal distribution 
	DONE
- rename 'a' and 'b' to 'lower' and 'upper'; 'nu' to 'df'
  => first arg should be 'upper' with default lower being '-Inf,...'
	DONE
- R should be 'scale' and we need a 'standardized = FALSE' argument;
  if standardized = TRUE, loc = 0 and sigma = correlation matrix is assumed
  ... or so)
	DONE
- 'swap' needs to be improved
- 'func' not needed if 'base case' in pnvmix() is part of the loop
  (only one call necessary then, so can be omitted)
	DONE
- more intuitive names for arguments concerning tolerance(s)
	DONE
- incorporate the case of a singular scale matrix
- consolidate pStudent, pmultinorm, pnvmix into one flexible function; pStudent and pmultinorm should then only be user friendly wrappers to call pnvmix with the corresponding arguments. This will leave us with only one C function and one big R function to maintain - the price to pay is a tiny loss in efficiency, shouldn't be a big deal though


### Misc #######################################################################

- Other *multivariate t* packages (2018-06-21):
  + monomvn (estimation under monotone pattern missing data; MLE & Bayesian)
  + mvnfast (no pnvmix(), simulation, density, Mahalanobis distances)
  + tmvtnorm (has ptmvt(), based on Gibbs sampler; see http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.26.6892)
  + MVT (studentFit(); for fixed nu (= eta here), estimates location and scale; paper mentions EM Algorithm)
  + mvtnorm (clear; no fitting, no non-integer dof, qmvt() [equicoordinate quantile function])
  + QRM (fit.mst())
